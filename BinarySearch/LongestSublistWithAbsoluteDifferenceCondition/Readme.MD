Given a list of integers nums and an integer k, return the length of the longest sublist where the absolute difference between the largest and smallest element of the sublist is ≤ k.

Constraints

n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Example 1
Input
nums = [1, 3, 5, 9]
k = 4
Output
3
Explanation
We pick [1, 3, 5] since the absolute difference is 4.
