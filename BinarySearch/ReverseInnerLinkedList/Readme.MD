Given a singly linked list node, and integers i and j, reverse the linked list from i to jth nodes, 0 indexed and inclusive.

You should return the head of the reversed list.

This should be done in 
O
(
1
)
O(1) space.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the number nodes in node
Example 1
Input
Visualize

node = [0, 1, 3, 4]
i = 1
j = 2
Output
Visualize
