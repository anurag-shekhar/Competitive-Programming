Given a list of integers nums and an integer target, return the number of sublists whose sum is equal to target.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Example 1
Input
nums = [2, 0, 2]
target = 2
Output
4
Explanation
We have these sublists whose sum is 2: [2], [2, 0], [0, 2], [2]
