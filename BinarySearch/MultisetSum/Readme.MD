Given a list of unique positive integers nums and a positive integer k, return the number of unique combinations that sum up to k. You may reuse numbers when creating combinations.

Constraints

n ≤ 25 where n is the length of nums
1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 250 for all 0 ≤ i < n
1 ≤ k ≤ 500
Example 1
Input
nums = [1, 2, 3]
k = 2
Output
2
Explanation
We can make 2 with [1, 1] and [2]
