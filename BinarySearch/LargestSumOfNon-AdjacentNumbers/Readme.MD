Given a list of integers nums, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums.
Example 1
Input
nums = [2, 4, 6, 2, 5]
Output
13
Explanation
We can take 2, 6, and 5 to get 13.
Example 2
Input
nums = [5, 1, 1, 5]
Output
10
Explanation
We can take 5 + 5 since they are not adjacent.
Example 3
Input
nums = [-10, -22, -18, -3, -100]
Output
0
Explanation
We don't pick any negative numbers.
