Let's call a positive integer 𝑛
n
 ordinary if in the decimal notation all its digits are the same. For example, 1
1
, 2
2
 and 99
99
 are ordinary numbers, but 719
719
 and 2021
2021
 are not ordinary numbers.

For a given number 𝑛
n
, find the number of ordinary numbers among the numbers from 1
1
 to 𝑛
n
.

Input
The first line contains one integer 𝑡
t
 (1≤𝑡≤104
1
≤
t
≤
10
4
). Then 𝑡
t
 test cases follow.

Each test case is characterized by one integer 𝑛
n
 (1≤𝑛≤109
1
≤
n
≤

9
).

Output
For each test case output the number of ordinary numbers among numbers from 1
1
 to 𝑛
n
.
