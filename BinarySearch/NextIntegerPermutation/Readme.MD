Given an integer n, return the next bigger permutation of its digits.

If n is already in its biggest permutation, rotate to the smallest permutation.

Constraints

n < 2 ** 31
Example 1
Input
n = 527
Output
572
Example 2
Input
n = 321
Output
123
Explanation
321 is already the biggest permutation so it rotates to the smallest.
Example 3
Input
n = 20
Output
2
