iGiven a list of integers nums and an integer k, return the number of sublists such that there's exactly k distinct numbers in the sublist.

Constraints

k ≤ n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Example 1
Input
nums = [1, 1, 2, 3]
k = 2
Output
3
Explanation
We have the following sublists which have exactly 2 distinct numbers: [1, 1, 2], [1, 2], [2, 3]
