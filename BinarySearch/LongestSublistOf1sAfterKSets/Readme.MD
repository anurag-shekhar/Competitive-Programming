You are given a list of integers nums containing 1s and 0s and an integer k. Given that you can set at most k 0s to 1s, return the length of the longest sublist containing all 1s.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Example 1
Input
nums = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
k = 2
Output
6
Explanation
We can set the two middle 0s to 1s and then the list becomes [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0].
