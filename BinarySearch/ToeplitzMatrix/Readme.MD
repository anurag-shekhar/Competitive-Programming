Given a two-dimensional matrix of integers matrix, determine whether it's a Toeplitz matrix. A Toeplitz is one where every diagonal descending from left to right has the same value.

Constraints

n, m â‰¤ 250 where n and m are the number of rows and columns in matrix
Example 1
Input
matrix = [
    [0, 1, 2],
    [3, 0, 1],
    [4, 3, 0],
    [5, 4, 3]
]
Output
true
Example 2
Input
matrix = [
    [1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1]
]
Output
false
