Given a list of integers nums sorted in ascending order, return whether it can be split into any number of subsequences such that each subsequence has at least length 3 and is consecutively increasing.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Example 1
Input
nums = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output
true
Explanation
We can split the list to [1, 2, 3] and [3, 4, 5, 6].
Example 2
Input
nums = [1, 2, 4]
Output
false
