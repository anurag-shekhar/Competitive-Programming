You are given a two-dimensional integer list requested_trips containing [start_x, end_x, num_passengers], and an integer capacity. Each requested trip asks to pick up num_passengers passenger at start_x and drop them off at end_x. You also have a car with the given capacity, and start at x = 0.

Given that you'd like to pick up every passenger and can only move right, return whether you can pick up and drop off everyone.
