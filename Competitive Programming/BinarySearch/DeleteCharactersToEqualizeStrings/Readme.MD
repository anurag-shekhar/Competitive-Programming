Given two lowercase alphabet strings a and b, consider an operation where we delete any character in either string. Return the minimum number of operations required such that both strings are equal.

Constraints

0 ≤ n ≤ 1,000 where n is the length of a
0 ≤ m ≤ 1,000 where m is the length of b
Example 1
Input
a = "zyyx"
b = "yfyx"
Output
2
Explanation
We delete the "z" in a and delete "f" in b
