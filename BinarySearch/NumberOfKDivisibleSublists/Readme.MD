Given a list of positive integers nums and an integer k, return the number of sublists whose sum is divisible by k.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Example 1
Input
nums = [5, 3, 2, 10]
k = 5
Output
6
Explanation
We have the following sublists whose sum is divisible by 5
[5]
[3, 2]
[10]
[5, 3, 2]
[3, 2, 10]
[5, 3, 2, 10]
