You are given a list of non-negative integers nums where each element represents the height of a hill. Suppose it will rain and all the spaces between two sides get filled up.

Return the amount of rain that would be caught between the hills.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Example 1
Input
nums = [2, 5, 2, 0, 5, 8, 8]
Output
8
Explanation
nums[2] can catch 3 rain drops, and nums[3] can catch 5 for a total of 8.
Example 2
Input
nums = [2, 1, 2]
Output
1
Explanation
We can hold 1 unit of water in middle.
Example 3
Input
nums = [3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 5]
Output
8
Explanation
We can hold 3 units in the first index, 2 in the second, and 3 in the fourth index (we cannot hold 5 since it would run off to the left), so we can catch 8 units of water.
