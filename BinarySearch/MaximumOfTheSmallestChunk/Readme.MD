iYou are given a list of positive integers nums and an integer k. You must split the list into k contiguous chunks. The smallest chunk is the one whose sum is the smallest out of all the chunks. Return the maximum possible value of the smallest chunk.

Constraints

1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums.
Example 1
Input
nums = [1, 5, 3, 4, 7]
k = 3
Output
6
Explanation
We can split the list into the following 3 chunks: [1, 5], [3, 4], [7]. The minimum chunk has a sum of 6.
