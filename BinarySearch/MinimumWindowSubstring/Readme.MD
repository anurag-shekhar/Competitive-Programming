Given two lowercase alphabet strings a and b, return the length of a minimum substring in a that contains all the characters of b.

If no such substring exists, return -1.

Constraints

0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of a
1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000 where m is the length of b
Example 1
Input
a = "qthequickbrownfox"
b = "qown"
Output
10
