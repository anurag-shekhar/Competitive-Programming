Given two strings a, and b, both representing an integer, multiply them and return it in the same string representation.

Can you implement the multiplication directly, instead of using eval() or built-in big integers?

Constraints`

n ≤ 200 where n is the length of a
m ≤ 200 where m is the length of b
Example 1
Input
a = "5"
b = "4"
Output
"20"
Example 2
Input
a = "2"
b = "-3"
Output
"-6"
