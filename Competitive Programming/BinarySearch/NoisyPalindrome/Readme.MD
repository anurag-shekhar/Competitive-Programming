You are given a string s containing lowercase and uppercase alphabet characters as well as digits from "0" to "9". Return whether s is a palindrome if we only consider the lowercase alphabet characters.

Constraints

0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of s
Example 1
Input
s = "a92bcbXa"
Output
true
Explanation
If we only consider the lowercase characters, then s is "abcba" which is a palindrome.
Example 2
Input
s = "abZ"
Output
false
