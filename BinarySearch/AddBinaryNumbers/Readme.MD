Given two strings a and b that represent binary numbers, add them and return their sum, also as a string.

The input strings are guaranteed to be non-empty and contain only 1s and 0s.

Constraints

n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of a
m ≤ 100,000 where m is the length of b
Example 1
Input
a = "1"
b = "1"
Output
"10"
Example 2
Input
a = "111"
b = "1"
Output
"1000"
